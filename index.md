OpenRIF is an open source community devoted to developing and
promoting interoperable and extensible semantic infrastructure for
scholarship.

OpenRIF community members currently work on various semantic
infrastructure components: 

- VIVO-ISF for representing people, works and the relationships of
  people and works eagle-i for representing research resources, and
  the relationship of those resources to people and their works
- SciENcv, the federal researcher profile and biosketch infrastructure
- PARDI, the NIH Portfolio Analysis and Reporting Data Infrastructure,
  for research impact and evaluation
- Others?

OpenRIF seeks to align with other information representation efforts
in scholarship to insure scalable/exchangeable information
infrastructure for scholarship.  Such related efforts include ORCiD,
SHARE, DataCite, NIH BD2K, LD4L, EuroCRIS and others. OpenRIF relies
on existing semantic infrastructure such as obo, bfo, foaf, skos, and
others to contribute to a growing effort to share semantics across
domains.
